gpio
============
This project contains a an example that goes through all gpios and 
sets them high/low every 100 ms.

The project makes use of code from the following library projects:
- CMSISv1p30_LPC13xx : for CMSIS 1.30 files relevant to LPC13xx
- MCU_Lib        	 : for LPC13xx peripheral driver files

These library projects must exist in the same workspace in order
for the project to successfully build.
